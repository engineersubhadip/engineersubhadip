### Hi there 👋

📌 I am a Frontend Engineer, currently working on exciting real work projects which cater to seamless user experience and customer satisfaction.

📌 I also have 3 years of work experience working as a Software Engineer where I customised end to end intricate test scenarios which tested UI performance and reliability, business functionality and many more. The through exposure in the field of testing ensured near bug-free application and customer gratification both of which resulted in lower churn rate.

📌 I strongly believe in the phylosophy that "Don't find customers for your product rather find products for your customers". Throughout all my years of working in a customer-centric domain, I know what customers generally look for when they visit a website. So I have curated a few real world end-to-end projects for your reference. I have targeted my audience primarily on the following data points:

    📍 Improving Customer Loyalty
    📍 Choice and Convinience
     and few more.
